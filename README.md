### How it works:
- **Objective**: The goal of the game is to guide a ball from a cannon's launch point into a basket by drawing ramps with the mouse within a limited time frame.
- **Gameplay**: Each level starts with the cannon and basket at new positions, creating unique challenges for the player.
The player has 10 seconds to draw ramps with the mouse on the screen. These ramps will guide the ball's trajectory towards the basket.
After the 10 seconds, the cannon automatically fires the ball along the drawn ramps.
The player must strategically design the ramps to ensure the ball reaches the basket successfully.
If the ball lands in the basket, the player advances to the next level with increased difficulty.
If the ball misses the basket, the player can retry the same level until they succeed.
- **Scoring**: Players can earn points based on their performance, such as successful shots, the time taken to complete each level, etc.
A scoring system can be implemented to encourage players to achieve higher scores and compete with friends.
- **Controls**: Mouse: Used for drawing ramps on the screen during the 10-second preparation time.
Keyboard (optional): Additional keyboard controls can be included for certain actions, like pausing the game or accessing the main menu.
- **Progression**: The game's difficulty gradually increases as players progress through levels, challenging their ramp-drawing skills.
Can be implemented to unlock new features, skins, or special abilities as they reach higher levels, adding an element of progression and reward.
